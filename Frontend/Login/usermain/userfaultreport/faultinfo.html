                <p><strong>3. When Should You File a Fault Report?</strong></p>
                <p>Filing a fault report is essential when an issue is significant enough to affect public safety, health, or the overall dining experience. Here’s a guide to help you determine if you should file a report:</p>
            
                <p><strong>3.1. Immediate Danger to Public Safety</strong></p>
                <p>If the fault poses an immediate risk to the safety of patrons (e.g., exposed wiring, fire hazards, or slippery floors), it should be reported immediately to prevent accidents.</p>
            
                <p><strong>3.2. Repeated Incidents</strong></p>
                <p>If you notice recurring issues that are not being addressed, such as trash bins that are consistently overflowing, report the issue. Continuous faults indicate a lack of maintenance and require prompt attention.</p>
            
                <p><strong>3.3. Health & Hygiene Violations</strong></p>
                <p>Health-related issues, like unhygienic food preparation, pest sightings, or expired ingredients, directly affect the well-being of diners and should be reported without delay.</p>
            
                <p><strong>3.4. Disruption of Normal Operations</strong></p>
                <p>If an issue disrupts the normal operation of the hawker center—such as non-functional fans during hot weather, broken seating, or unavailable washing areas—it is recommended to file a report. This will alert maintenance teams to resolve the issue quickly.</p>
            
                <p><strong>3.5. Customer Experience Impact</strong></p>
                <p>While minor inconveniences can often be overlooked, issues that significantly affect the customer experience (e.g., unresponsive or rude stall staff, mispriced items) should be reported. This helps management maintain high standards of service and ensures fair pricing practices.</p>
            
                <p><strong>4. Best Practices for Filing a Fault Report</strong></p>
                <p><strong>4.1. Be Specific and Detailed</strong></p>
                <p>Provide as much detail as possible, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Exact Location:</strong> Specify the stall number, section, or nearby landmarks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time and Date:</strong> Mention when you observed the fault. This helps in tracking down intermittent issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Description of the Issue:</strong> Describe the issue clearly, such as "Trash bin overflowing near Stall 7 in Section B."</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p><strong>4.2. Use Visual Evidence</strong></p>
                <p>Whenever possible, attach photos of the fault. Visual evidence supports your report and helps maintenance teams better understand the issue.</p>
            
                <p><strong>4.3. Classify the Severity of the Issue</strong></p>
                <p>Some apps may allow you to classify the fault based on its severity (e.g., low, medium, high). This prioritization helps in assigning urgent tasks to maintenance staff.</p>
            
                <p><strong>4.4. Provide Follow-Up Information</strong></p>
                <p>If the issue persists after a report, consider following up or filing an additional report. Continuous updates help the maintenance team to understand the scope and duration of unresolved issues.</p>
            
                <p><strong>5. Examples of Effective Fault Reports</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example 1: Safety Hazard</strong><br>
                        Report Title: "Exposed Wiring Near Sink in Section C"<br>
                        Description: "There is an exposed electrical wire near the washing area in Section C. This could pose a safety risk, especially for children."
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Example 2: Cleanliness Issue</strong><br>
                        Report Title: "Overflowing Trash Bin by Stall 10"<br>
                        Description: "The trash bin next to Stall 10 has been full since this morning, and trash is starting to accumulate around it. Please have it emptied."
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Example 3: Food Quality Concern</strong><br>
                        Report Title: "Expired Seafood at Stall 5"<br>
                        Description: "I noticed a foul smell coming from the seafood at Stall 5. The prawns appeared discolored, and there is a risk of food poisoning if consumed."
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
                <p><strong>6. Common Mistakes to Avoid When Filing a Report</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Being Vague:</strong> Avoid vague descriptions like "dirty area" or "bad food." Specific details help address the problem quickly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Using Inappropriate Language:</strong> Ensure that the report remains respectful and professional.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reporting Minor Inconveniences:</strong> Only file reports for issues that impact safety, health, or the experience of other patrons. Minor inconveniences may not warrant a report.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p><strong>7. What Happens After You File a Report?</strong></p>
                <p>After filing a report, here’s what typically happens:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Acknowledgment:</strong> You may receive a notification that your report has been received.</li>
                    <li><strong>Review by Maintenance Team:</strong> The fault is reviewed, prioritized, and assigned to the relevant personnel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Depending on the severity, the fault may be resolved within a few hours or days.</li>
                    <li><strong>Follow-Up:</strong> In some cases, you may receive a follow-up notification once the issue has been addressed.</li>
